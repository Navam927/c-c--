strcmpi(): Same as strcmp functions. But this functions negotiates case. "A" and "a" are treated the same.
strstr(): Returns pointer to first occurence of str2 in str1.
strrstr(): Returns pointer to last occurence of str2 in str1.
strlen(): Returns the length of string.
strchr(): Returns the first occurence of char in str1.
strrchr(): Returns the last occurence of char in str1.
strlwr(): Converts the string to lower case.
strupr(): Converts the string to upper case.
strdup(): Duplicates the string.
